# Raytracer

## How to build

 - If you're building for the first time, run `make deps` to clone and build the [GifEncoder](https://github.com/xiaozhuai/GifEncoder) library.
 - `make` will build the raytracer itself.

## Usage

 - As of now, just running `./raytracer` will output a scene.bmp file and print the render time in console. (640x480 image)
